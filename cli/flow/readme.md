## Notes

- Running `fgo` without any arguments opens an embedded fzf palette so you can fuzzy-search commands and read their descriptions before executing them.
- For `fgo commit`, export `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell profile (e.g. fish config) so the CLI can talk to OpenAI. This environment variable is the only requirement, so the command works in local shells and CI alike.
- For `fgo youtubeToSound`, the CLI automatically passes `--cookies-from-browser` using Safari cookies. Override this by setting `FLOW_YOUTUBE_COOKIES_BROWSER` (e.g. `firefox`), set it to `none` to skip cookies entirely, or pass your own `--cookies*` flags after the URLâ€”they are forwarded directly to `yt-dlp`.
- If you run `fgo youtubeToSound` without arguments, the command grabs the frontmost Safari tab URL automatically.
- `fgo gitSetupFork <private-url> [original-url]` renames the cloned remote to `upstream` when needed, points `origin` at your private fork, and keeps the original repository handy for fetches.
- `fgo gitFetchUpstream [--all] [remote]` fetches upstream (default) or every remote while pruning stale refs.
- `fgo gitSyncFork` rebases or merges your local branch onto `upstream/<branch>` so you stay current with the original project.
- A shorthand `fe` symlink is installed alongside `fgo`; repoint or remove `~/bin/fe` if you prefer a different alias.
