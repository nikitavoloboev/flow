## Notes

Running `fgo` without any arguments opens an embedded fzf palette so you can fuzzy-search commands and read their descriptions before executing them.

For `fgo commit`, export `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell profile (e.g. fish config) so the CLI can talk to OpenAI. This environment variable is the only requirement, so the command works in local shells and CI alike.

For `fgo youtubeToSound`, the CLI automatically passes `--cookies-from-browser` using Safari cookies. Override this by setting `FLOW_YOUTUBE_COOKIES_BROWSER` (e.g. `firefox`), set it to `none` to skip cookies entirely, or pass your own `--cookies*` flags after the URLâ€”they are forwarded directly to `yt-dlp`.

If you run `fgo youtubeToSound` without arguments, the command grabs the frontmost Safari tab URL automatically.

A shorthand `fe` alias is installed alongside `fgo`; update or remove the symlink at ~/bin/fe if you prefer a different name.
